# Change fragments

This repository uses a small, dependency-free change-fragment workflow inspired
by the Changesets setup in BIRD-LSP. It keeps release notes reviewable in pull
requests without introducing an npm package solely for release tooling.

## Add a fragment

Create a kebab-case fragment name and select its semantic-version bump and
category:

```sh
node scripts/changeset.mjs new bright-birds patch fixed
```

Edit the generated file and replace both placeholder paragraphs. Release notes
use the BIRD-LSP style: a bilingual title, followed by a Simplified Chinese
paragraph and an English paragraph.

```md
---
bump: patch
category: fixed
---

- 🐛 **中文标题** / **English title**

  中文说明。

  English summary.
```

Supported bumps are `patch`, `minor`, and `major`. Supported categories are
listed in `config.json`. Add a fragment for any user-visible or release-worthy
change; purely internal test or CI maintenance may omit one.

## Check pending changes

```sh
node scripts/changeset.mjs check
node scripts/changeset.mjs status
```

CI runs `check` automatically. It validates the emoji, bilingual title,
two-space paragraph indentation, and Chinese/English paragraph order. `status`
lists pending fragments and reports the highest requested bump.

To preview the notes for a version that is already in the changelog:

```sh
node scripts/changeset.mjs notes 1.0.13
```

Use inline Markdown links in fragments so extracted GitHub Release notes remain
self-contained.

## Prepare a release

1. Inspect the pending fragments with `status`.
2. Choose the next plugin version, synchronize the canonical syntax snapshot,
   and update any version references in `doc/bird2.txt` as appropriate.
3. Preview the generated changelog section:

   ```sh
   node scripts/changeset.mjs release 1.0.14 \
     --date 2026-07-18 --dry-run
   ```

4. Run the same command without `--dry-run`. It inserts the new bilingual
   section in `CHANGELOG.md` and deletes the consumed fragments.
5. Review and commit the resulting release diff, then create the matching
   standard SemVer tag (`v1.0.14`, for example). The Release workflow validates
   that the tag matches the runtime version before publishing archives.

The command intentionally does not modify Vim runtime files or create tags.
Version and syntax-snapshot updates remain explicit release-review steps.
